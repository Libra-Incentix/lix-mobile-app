On the marketplace offer, the Buy button will only be clickable  when the user has enough lix points, other wise the user is asked to earn more lix

The LIX bonus is not working yet for SHARE NOW on social media - we will create a general 5 lix bonus every time someone clicks SHARE NOW and generate an email to the user. - Timmy will give the end point for Robin to consumer every time user clicks on SHARE NOW - the existing one will be modified on today

No notifications for earning or redeeming are coming through - the only notifications are for logging in and OTP - Timmy to check this out- the notification should not show the OTP

The redeemed date is not coming through because robin does not have redeemed coupon in his account - Robin will test this today

In the notifications mobile screen, EXPIRATION DATE will only show if the brand admin has configured an expiration date - Robin will validate this
