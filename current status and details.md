=============================================================

Facebook - facebook app id - Dave to send the facebook IDs but Robin will use his own for the time being

Show name on the home page - in progress - Robin

Images do not show -   when app 2 is merged to app 1 this will work - end of 01/11 - Timmy

On the marketplace offer, the Buy button will only be clickable  when the user has enough lix points, other wise the user is asked to earn more lix

The LIX bonus is not working yet for SHARE NOW on social media - we will create a general 5 lix bonus every time someone clicks SHARE NOW and generate an email to the user. - Timmy will give the end point for Robin to consumer every time user clicks on SHARE NOW - the existing one will be modified on today

No notifications for earning or redeeming are coming through - the only notifications are for logging in and OTP - Timmy to check this out- the notification should not show the OTP

The redeemed date is not coming through because robin does not have redeemed coupon in his account - Robin will test this today

In the notifications mobile screen, EXPIRATION DATE will only show if the brand admin has configured an expiration date - Robin will validate this

We do not have country-code showing in the ap - there is an API for this info - Timmy will share this with Robin today

Robin will change the word DEALS to MARKETPLACE throughout ##DONE

Timmy will create an email notification for account deactivation and deletion

Actions in priority order: 
1. LIX logo on the app icon is not the correct dimensions- its too stretched - Robin to fix
2. LIX logo inside the app is not the correct dimensions- its too stretched - Robin to fix
3. When using the transfer, fund and withdraw buttons, the user details should already be visible in the web app, instead of having to add the credentials again - Timmy to do
4. Robin to change to “staff member ID” Timmy will provide the sample key for the staff member ID
5. We need find a better way to capture the telephone number

1. LOGOs inside the app are not the correct dimensions. Need to auto adjust logo images
LOGOs inside the app are not the correct dimensions. Dimensions of images need to auto adjust when a user uploads them. We want to make sure it is rendering always the whole image or majority of the image, while focusing on center of it.

2. LIX logo on the app icon it is not the correct dimensions, too stretched
LIX logo on the app icon it is not the correct dimensions, too stretched. Needs to be aligned with LIX logo standard
